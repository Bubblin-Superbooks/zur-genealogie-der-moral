But does all this involve any real effort to <em>counteract</em> the ascetic ideal? Is it really seriously suggested that Kant's <em>victory</em> over the theological dogmatism about "God," "Soul," "Freedom," "Immortality," has damaged that ideal in any way (as the theologians have imagined to be the case for a long time past)?–– And in this connection it does not concern us for a single minute, if Kant himself intended any such consummation. It is certain that from the time of Kant every type of transcendentalist is playing a winning game––they are emancipated from the theologians;</p></div> </div>
