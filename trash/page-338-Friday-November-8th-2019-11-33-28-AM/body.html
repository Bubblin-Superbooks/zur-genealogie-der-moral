The whole Romantic School with its belief in "the people" is refuted! No Homeric poetry as "popular" poetry! No deification of the great powers of Nature! No deduction from language-relationship to race-relationship! No "intellectual contemplations" of the supernatural! No truth enshrouded in religion!</p><p>The problem of truthfulness is quite a new one. I am astonished. From this standpoint we regard such natures as Bismarck as culpable out of carelessness, such as Richard Wagner out of want of modesty; we would condemn Plato for his <em>pia fraus</em>, Kant for the derivation of his Categorical Imperative, his own belief certainly not having come to him from this source.</p><p>Finally, even doubt turns against itself: doubt in doubt. And the question as to the <em>value</em> of truthfulness and its extent lies <em>there</em>.</p></div> </div>
