The darkening of the heavens over man has always increased in proportion to the growth of man's shame <em>before man</em>. The tired pessimistic outlook, the mistrust of the riddle of life, the icy negation of disgusted ennui, all those are not the signs of the <em>most evil</em> age of the human race: much rather do they come first to the light of day, as the swamp-flowers, which they are, when the swamp to which they belong, comes into existence—I mean the diseased refinement and moralisation, thanks</p></div> </div>
