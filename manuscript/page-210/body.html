<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">back again to our first question, "What is the <em>meaning</em> of a philosopher paying homage to ascetic ideals?" We get now, at any rate, a first hint; he wishes to <em>escape from a torture</em>.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Let us beware of making dismal faces at the word "torture"—there is certainly in this case enough to deduct, enough to discount—there is even something to laugh at. For we must certainly not underestimate the fact that Schopenhauer, who in practice treated sexuality as a  personal enemy (including its tool, woman, that "<em>instrumentum diaboli</em>"), needed enemies to keep him in a good humour; that he loved grim, bitter, blackish-green words; that he raged for the sake of raging, out of passion; that he would have grown ill, would have become a <em>pessimist</em> (for he was not a pessimist, however much he wished to be), without his enemies, without Hegel, woman, sensuality, and the whole "will for existence" "keeping on." Without them</p></div> </div>
