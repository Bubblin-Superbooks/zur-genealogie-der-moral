Their inveterate naïveté. They find out some "end" in the punishment, for instance, revenge and deterrence, and then in all their innocence set this end at the beginning, as the <em>causa fiendi</em> of the punishment, and—they have done the trick. But the patching up of a history of the origin of law is the last use to which the "End in Law" ought to be put. Perhaps there is no more pregnant principle for any kind of history than the following, which, difficult though it is to master, <em>should</em> none the less be <em>mastered</em> in every detail.—The origin of the existence of a thing and its final utility, its practical application and incorporation in a system of ends, are <em>toto cœlo</em> opposed to each other—everything, anything, which exists and which prevails anywhere, will always be put to new purposes by a force superior to itself, will be commandeered afresh, will be turned and transformed</p></div> </div>
