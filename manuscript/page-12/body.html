<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Preface.</h3><p class="  start-chapter">We are unknown, we knowers, ourselves to ourselves: this has its own good reason. We have never searched for ourselves—how should it then come to pass, that we should ever <em>find</em> ourselves? Rightly has it been said: "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." <em>Our</em> treasure is there, where stand the hives of our knowledge. It is to those hives that we are always striving; as born creatures of flight, and as the honey-gatherers of the spirit, we care really in our hearts only for one thing—to bring something "home to the hive!"</p></div> </div>
