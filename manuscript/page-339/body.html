<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>What I observe with pleasure in the German is his Mephistophelian nature; but, to tell the truth, one must have a higher conception of Mephistopheles than Goethe had, who found it necessary to <em>diminish</em> his Mephistopheles in order to magnify his "inner Faust." The true German Mephistopheles  is much more dangerous, bold, wicked, and cunning, and <em>consequently</em> more open-hearted: remember the nature of Frederick the Great, or of that much greater Frederick, the Hohenstaufen, Frederick II.</p><p>The real German Mephistopheles crosses the Alps, and believes that everything there belongs to him. Then he recovers himself, like Winckelmann, like Mozart. He looks upon Faust and Hamlet as caricatures, invented to be laughed at, and upon Luther also. Goethe had his good <em>German</em> moments, when he laughed inwardly at all these things. But then he fell back again into his cloudy moods.</p></div> </div>
